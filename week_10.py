- 1.Build a mathematical model

Think about how the exchange-rate table can be represented mathematically, what condition would indicate a multi-currency arbitrage opportunity, and how the gain along a sequence of currency exchanges should be calculated.

- 2.Choose a solution strategy

Consider whether you want to test a few cycles manually, search systematically for possible arbitrage cycles, treat the problem as a graph problem, or transform the multiplicative relationships into a form that is easier to analyse.

- 3.Implement the method in code

Think about how to store the exchange-rate data, how to represent the structure of the problem in code, how to implement your detection method, and what output your program should produce.

- 4.Check and validate the result

Do not assume that a computed result is automatically correct. Check whether the output is consistent with your mathematical model, whether a detected path really produces arbitrage, and whether a failure to detect arbitrage reflects the actual problem rather than an issue in the code or method.

- 5.Interpret and present the solution

Finally, explain clearly what your result means. State whether an arbitrage opportunity exists, what evidence supports your conclusion, and how your mathematical model, code output, and final interpretation connect to one another.

TASK_HINTS = {
    "Arbitrage": {
        1: """Hint for Task 1: Build a Mathematical Model

At this stage, focus on translating the problem into a mathematical form before coding. Think about what each exchange rate means, how to represent a currency conversion mathematically, and what condition would indicate arbitrage.

You may find it helpful to define:

- a_ij: the exchange rate from currency i to currency j
- x_ij: the amount of currency i converted to currency j
- y_k: the net amount of currency k after all transactions

Then ask yourself:

What objective should be maximized?

How should the flow-balance constraints be written?

How can the model indicate whether arbitrage exists?

One possible way to think about the problem is to use a_ij, x_ij, and y_k to describe exchange rates, transaction flows, and net outcomes, and then consider whether the model can produce a profitable closed cycle of exchanges.""",

        2: """Hint for Task 2: Choose a Solution Strategy

Once your mathematical model is clear, the next step is to decide how you want to solve the problem. Try not to move directly to coding before you have chosen a method.

You may find it helpful to think about questions such as:

- Do I want to solve this as an optimisation problem, a graph problem, or another type of problem?
- What should my method take as input, and what should it return as output?
- If arbitrage exists, how will I identify the profitable cycle or path?
- How can I make sure that my method matches the mathematical model I built?""",

        3: """Hint for Task 3: Implement the Method in Code

Now use your mathematical model and chosen strategy to guide your coding. Try to keep the code aligned with your own reasoning, rather than writing code first and hoping it works.

A useful coding plan may include:

- loading or storing the exchange-rate data clearly  
- writing a function to detect whether arbitrage exists  
- writing a second function, if needed, to recover the arbitrage path or cycle  
- testing your code on the given exchange-rate table  

You do not need to follow this structure exactly, but it may help you think about how to separate the problem into clear coding steps. As you code, keep asking yourself whether each part of the program corresponds to something meaningful in your mathematical model.

Example code skeleton:

```python
from gurobipy import Model, GRB, quicksum
import numpy as np

def arbitrage_detection(rates):
    # build the model here
    # define decision variables
    # set the objective
    # add the constraints
    # solve the model
    pass

def find_the_path(x_opt_indices):
    # reconstruct a path from the nonzero decisions
    pass
```

Example of loading the rate matrix:

```python
import pandas as pd
rates_df = pd.read_csv("arbitrage.csv")
rates = rates_df.values[:, 1:]  # adjust this if needed
```

""",

        4: """Hint for Task 4: Check and Validate the Result

After you obtain a result, do not assume that it is automatically correct. Your next job is to check whether the output really matches the mathematical meaning of arbitrage.

You may find it helpful to ask:

- Does my code say that arbitrage exists or not?
- If arbitrage exists, does the reported path or cycle actually make sense?
- If I multiply the exchange rates along that cycle, do I really end up with more than I started with?
- If no arbitrage is found, could that be due to a problem in my code or method rather than the data itself?

Example validation idea:

```python
if all_one:
    arbitrage_path = find_the_path(np.argwhere(x_opt))
    print("Arbitrage path is:", arbitrage_path)
```

You may also try a simple manual check on one reported path to confirm that the result is consistent with your model and code.""",

        5: """Hint for Task 5: Interpret and Present the Solution

In this task, do not only report the code output. Explain what the result means in relation to the original problem and how your conclusion is supported by both the model and the computation.

A clear final explanation may include:

- whether an arbitrage opportunity exists  
- if yes, what the profitable path or cycle is  
- why that path creates profit  
- if no arbitrage is found, what evidence supports that conclusion  
- how your mathematical model, code output, and interpretation connect to one another

Before you start solving the problem, try to break it into a few smaller tasks. This can help you organize your thinking and avoid jumping into code too quickly.

A possible way to divide the work is:

- Task 1: Explore the dataset and visualize the first 10 hawker centres on a map
- Task 2: Decide on a solution strategy for the delivery route problem
- Task 3: Implement the method in code, including distance calculation and route solving
- Task 4: Check and validate whether the route is correct
- Task 5: Interpret and present the final solution clearly

        1: """Hint for Task 1: Explore the Data and Visualize the First 10 Hawker Centres

First, load the dataset and identify the columns containing the hawker centre names and coordinates. Then keep only the first 10 hawker centres and plot them on a map. This step helps you understand the delivery locations before starting the optimization.

Essential code structure:

```python
import pandas as pd
import folium

df = pd.read_csv("hawker_centres.csv")
df = df.head(10).copy()

Before writing the full program, think about how this milk delivery problem should be solved. Your goal is to find a route that visits each hawker centre once and returns to the starting point with the minimum total travel distance.

- What should the input be: coordinates, a distance matrix, or something else?
- What should the output be: a route, a list of locations in visiting order, or both?
- How will I represent the route in code?
- How can I organize the problem into clear steps before writing the full solution?

One possible way is to break the task into smaller functions. For example:

```python

After you obtain a route, do not assume that it is automatically correct. Your next job is to check whether the output really matches the delivery problem.

You may find it helpful to ask:

- Does the route visit every hawker centre exactly once?
- Does the route return to the starting point?
- Is the visiting order complete and sensible?
- Does the route match the distance data used in the program?
- If the result looks unusual, could the issue come from the distance matrix, the solver logic, or the way the path was reconstructed?

Example validation structure:

```python
print("Route:", path)

# check whether all locations are included
print("Number of stops in route:", len(path))

# optional: inspect whether the route returns to the start
print("Start:", path[0], "End:", path[-1])

In this task, do not only report the code output. Explain what the final route means in relation to the original milk delivery problem and present the result in a clear way.

A clear final explanation may include:

- the final visiting order
- whether the route forms a complete delivery tour
- how the result is shown on the map
- what the route suggests about the delivery plan
- how your code output and interpretation connect to one another

Example presentation structure:

```python
print("Final route:", path)

# create a map
# add hawker centre markers
# draw the route in visiting order
# display the map

Try to present your solution in a way that makes your reasoning visible, rather than only stating the final answer.

At this stage, focus on keeping your work aligned with your own task plan and reasoning.

You may find it helpful to ask:

- What exactly is this task trying to achieve?
- How does this task connect to my earlier model, method, or result?
- What kind of AI support do I actually need here: explanation, options, checking, debugging, or interpretation?
- What part of this task should still remain my responsibility?
- How will I know whether the output is valid, useful, and relevant to the problem?

Try to make sure that:
- your task goal is clear,
- your prompt asks for specific help,
- your evaluation checks the response critically,
- and your next step follows from evidence rather than convenience.

At this stage, focus on translating the arbitrage problem into a mathematical form before coding. Think carefully about what each exchange rate means, how a currency conversion should be represented, and what mathematical condition would indicate arbitrage.

A useful starting point is to define:

- **aij**: the exchange rate from currency *i* to currency *j*
- **xij**: the amount of currency *i* converted to currency *j*
- **yk**: the net amount of currency *k* after all transactions

Your goal in this step is to clarify the mathematical structure of the problem.

If you use AI at this stage, the prompt should focus on mathematical modelling rather than coding.

Now use the model you have built and check whether it is logically sound. Make sure the variables, objective, and constraints are consistent with the meaning of arbitrage.
